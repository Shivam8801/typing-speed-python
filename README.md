# typing-speed-python

The typing speed test project is a Python application that uses the tkinter module to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the user to interact with. The time module is utilized to calculate the duration of the typing test, and the threading module is used to run the test in the background while the user types.

To generate the text for the test, the random module is used to select a random sentence from a list of pre-defined sentences. Once the test is completed, the program calculates the number of characters, words, and sentences typed by the user, and uses this data to calculate the typing speed in characters per second (CPS), characters per minute (CPM), words per second (WPS), and words per minute (WPM).

Overall, this project provides an interactive and engaging way for users to test and improve their typing speed, while also demonstrating the use of several commonly used Python modules for GUI development and data manipulation.
